#Day_1: The first Challenge for today was to write your full name and today's date in separate lines of code.

full_name = ("John Spratt")
todays_date =("11/23/2024")

print (full_name)
print(todays_date)

#Day_1: The second challenge is to copy the text below and see if we can it with just one print statement.

statement = ("""I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happend to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!
I am feeling happy :-).
You can follow my progress at https://github.com/J-Spratt/JCodeChronicles""")
