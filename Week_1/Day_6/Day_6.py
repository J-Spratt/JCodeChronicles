#Day 6 - Learn 'elif' statements. Can you create a login system to keep passwords safe from hackers?

#slide 1
"""
What the elif is this?

The elif command (which stands for 'elseif') allows you to ask 2, 3, 4 or 142 questions using the same input! This command must be in a certain place. You can have as many elif statements as you want, but they must go in between if and else and have the same indentation. The print statements in your elif command need to line up with the indent of the other print statements.
 

Where would an elif statement go in the code below?

print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
if username == "mark":
  print("Welcome Mark!")
else:
  print("Go away!")
An elif statement would go in between the if and else statements.
 

ðŸ‘‰ Add this elif statement to the code above. Make sure you indent properly AND put it in between the if and else statements!

elif username == "suzanne":
  print("Hey there Suzanne!")
 

Your code should look like this:

print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
if username == "mark":
  print("Welcome Mark!")
elif username == "suzanne":
  print("Hey there Suzanne!")
else:
  print("Go away!")

"""
#slide 2
"""
Add a password

Let's add a bit more input.

ðŸ‘‰ Now that we have input for both a username and password, we need to change our if and elif statements just a bit so both the username and password must match for Mark and Suzanne to login.

print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
password = input("Password> ")
 

ðŸ‘‰ In the code below the username and password must both be correct for Mark to login.

print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
password = input("Password> ")
if username == "mark" and password == "password":
 print("Welcome Mark!")
elif username == "suzanne":
 print("Hey there Suzanne!")
else:
 print("Go away!")
 

ðŸ‘‰ Suzanne's password is 'Su74nne'. Can you add that to the code above? (HINT: It should be very similar to Mark.)

print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
password = input("Password> ")
if username == "mark" and password == "password":
 print("Welcome Mark!")
elif username == "suzanne" and password == "Su74nne":
 print("Hey there Suzanne!")
else:
 print("Go away!")

Syntax Error

ðŸ‘‰ What is wrong the code below?

print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
if username == "mark":
  print("Welcome Mark!")
else:
  print("Go away!")
elif username == "suzanne":
  print("Hey there Suzanne!")
The elif statement is in the wrong place. It must go in between the if and else statements.

print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
if username == "mark":
  print("Welcome Mark!")
elif username == "suzanne":
  print("Hey there Suzanne!")
else:

ðŸ‘‰ Day 6 Challenge

Make your own login program.

Create a program where someone logins with their username and password correctly 
and then gets a lovely individual greeting.
Write a specific personalized greeting for 3 different people.
Don't forget an else statement for everyone else who shouldn't be logging in.
